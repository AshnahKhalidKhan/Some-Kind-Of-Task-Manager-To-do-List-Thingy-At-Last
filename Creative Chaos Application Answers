What is something that you have worked on that you're proud of? 
My GDSC "Everything" app prototype.

Define what success means to you? 
Draining yourself out of every single ounce of effort and passion to accomplish something you, as small as it may be, set out to do and finally achieving it. Putting your absolute everything into something, and it being enough to get you what you wanted.

If you were shipwrecked on a deserted island, but all your human needs—such as food and water—were taken care of, what two items would you want to have with you (state the reason for each)?
A notebook that never runs out of blank pages no matter how many I fill it with, and a pen that never runs out of black ink no matter how much I write with it. That notebook will contain my thoughts to help me navigate everyday, my ideas to fuel ambition and help me make plans and blueprints for fulfilling them, and lastly, it will provide me material to draw or make paper cranes or do origami when I just want to have relax and fun. Self-awareness, ambition, passion; all at once. The "black" ink is important because black, to me, signifies sureness and grit and determinism (and because I LOVE the way black ink looks on white paper). The never-ending-ness of both items is important because I want all that these items signify to last my entire life.
