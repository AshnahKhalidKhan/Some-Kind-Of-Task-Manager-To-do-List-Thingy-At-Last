12. If you answered yes, please provide details of your previous volunteer experience(s).
Most notably, my experience in 2023 WRO Nationals (Karachi) as Judge for RoboMission Elementary module.

14. What skills, qualifications or interest do you possess that will be useful for this role?
Prior experience in judging the WRO Nationals (Karachi) last year, an ever-growing experience in leading robotics training for highschool female students such as in Dawood Public School's STEM Club collaboration, and a keen interest in mechatronics as a career. In addition. After my experience last year in judging the RoboMission category, this year I'm eagerly looking forward to judging the Future Innovators or Future Engineers category (In Shaa Allah).

19. Why do you want to volunteer/be a judge at WRO Pakistan?
To put it briefly: same motivations that made me apply for a position last year. I was truly thankful for Zartaj for recognizing my enthusiasm for STEM in Pakistan in the WomenInTech conference last year, and inviting me to be a part of WRO. As a pioneer in my own small ventures to encourage the growth of STEM education in our country, her dedication to uplifting STEM education in Pakistan, especially for girls, is truly commendable and WRO is my chance to be a part of something that does the same on a much large scale. I would not be lying if I said I had mentally convinced myself to apply for the same opportunity this year the moment the event ended last year, and I truly look forward to another incredibly exciting and memorable experience this year as well!
